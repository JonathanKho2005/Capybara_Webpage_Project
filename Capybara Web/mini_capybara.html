        <p>Guinea pigs, affectionately nicknamed "mini capybaras" by fans of their chubby charm, are small rodents known for their gentle nature and potato-shaped bodies. Especially the brown-colored ones, with their rounded faces and stout frames, bear a striking resemblance to capybaras â€” the largest rodents on earth.</p>
        <p>While guinea pigs and capybaras aren't directly related in a close biological sense, they do share the same scientific order: Rodentia. This means they are distant cousins in the rodent family tree. Their similar body shape and calm demeanor often lead people to mistake guinea pigs as baby capybaras or members of the same species.</p>
        <p>In reality, guinea pigs hail from the Andes region of South America and have been domesticated for centuries, while capybaras are semi-aquatic giants found in wetlands and rivers across much of South America. Despite their size difference, both animals are social, expressive, and beloved for their adorable quirks.</p>
        <p>So whether you're admiring a capybara lounging in a hot spring or a guinea pig munching on a carrot, you're enjoying two most lovable potatoes in nature.</p>
