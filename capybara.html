        <p>Before there were guinea pigs, there were capybaras — the chill masters of the animal kingdom. Known for their calm nature and surprising friendships with animals of all kinds, capybaras have become a global symbol of peace and connection.</p>
        <p>Their gentle presence and quiet confidence inspire us here at Guinea Haven. We believe guinea pigs carry that same peaceful energy — just in a smaller, cuddlier form.</p>
        <p>At Guinea Haven, our love for guinea pigs began with admiration for the capybara’s serene spirit. Every wiggle, squeak, and nap in a cozy corner reminds us of their big cousins’ calmness. It’s that harmony and kindness that we hope to share with every visitor who steps into our little haven.</p>
